# Part 3

Consider the dataset called `students.csv` with the following contents: 

```
ID,Name,Age,Gender,Grade,Subject
1,Alice,20,F,88,Math
2,Bob,22,M,76,History
3,Charlie,23,M,90,Math
4,Diana,21,F,85,Science
5,Eve,20,F,92,Math
6,Frank,22,M,72,History
7,Grace,23,F,78,Science
8,Heidi,21,F,88,Math
9,Ivan,20,M,85,Science
10,Judy,22,F,79,History
```

1. Use [`wget`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget) to download the `students.csv` file locally from [here](https://github.com/stephaniehicks/jhustatprogramming2024/blob/main/projects/01-project/students.csv).

``` {bash}
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stephaniehicks/jhustatprogramming2024/main/projects/01-project/students.csv
```

2. Display the contents of the `students.csv` file using the `cat` command.

```{bash}
cat students.csv
```

3. Display only the first 5 lines of the file using `head` to show the first few lines. 
```{bash}
head -n 5 students.csv
```

4. Display only the last 3 lines of the file using `tail` to show the last few lines.

```{bash}
tail -n 3 students.csv
```

5. Count the number of lines in the file using the `wc` command to count the lines.

```{bash}
wc -l students.csv
```

6. Find all students who are taking "Math" as a subject using `grep` to filter lines with the subject "Math".

```{bash}
grep "Math" students.csv
```

7. Find all female students using `grep` or `awk` to filter based on gender.

```{bash}
grep ",F," students.csv
```

8. Sort the file by the students' ages in ascending order. Use `sort` to order by the "Age" column.

```{bash}
sort -t, -k3,3n students.csv
```

9. Find the unique subjects listed in the file. Use `cut`, `sort`, and `uniq` to extract unique subjects.

```{bash}
cut -d, -f6 students.csv | sort | uniq
```

10. Calculate the average grade of the students. Use `awk` to sum the grades and divide by the number of students.

```{bash}
awk -F, '{sum += $5; count++} END {if (count > 0) print sum / count}' students.csv
```

11. Replace all occurrences of "Math" with "Mathematics" in the file. Use `sed` to perform the replacement.

```{bash}
sed -i '' 's/Math/Mathematics/g' students.csv
```
